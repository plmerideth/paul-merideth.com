				<b>PARAGRAPHS FOUR & FIVE</b>
			</p>
			<p class="procText">
				THE FIRST COMMANDMENT that God gave to Adam and Eve pertained to their potential for parenthood as husband and wife.  We declare that God's commandment for His children to multiply and replenish the earth remains in force.  We further declare that God has commanded the sacred powers of procreation are to be employed only betweeen man and woman, lawfully wedded as husband and wife.
			</p>
			<p class="procText">
				WE DECLARE the means by which mortal life is created to be divinely appointed.  We affirm the sanctity of life and of its importance in God's eternal plan.
			</p>
			<p class="general">
				Paragraphs four and five describe God's law of chastity and the sanctity of life.  In connection with these two paragraphs I read quite a few talks, including one of my favorite talks of all time - <em>"Of Souls, Symbols, and Sacraments"</em> by Jeffrey R. Holland.  In his talk, Elder Holland does a magnificent job of explaining why we should be clean and why moral discipline is such a significant matter in God's eyes.

				I also really enjoyed an article by Kenneth W. Matheson, a Professor of Social Work at BYU, entitled <em>"Fidelity in Marriage: It's More than you Think"</em>

				"Of Souls, Symbols, and Sacraments"
			</p>
			<p class="talkAuthor">
				Elder Jeffrey R. Holland, Deseret Book, Salt Lake City, 2001
			</p>
			<p class="general">
				Elder Holland points out that sexual transgression is second only to murder in the Lord's list of life's most serious sins.  As Elder Holland puts it, <em>"Clearly God's greatest concerns regarding mortality are how one gets into this world and how one gets out of it."</em>  Regarding the taking of life, he says this:
			</p>
			<p class="talkQuote">
				"As for the taking of life, we are generally quite responsible.  Most people, it seems to me, readily sense the sanctity of life and as a rule do not run up to friends, put a loaded revolver to their heads, and cavalierly pull the trigger.  Furthermore, when there is a click of the hammer rather than an explosion of lead, and a possible tragedy seems to have been averted, no one in such a circumstance would be so stupid as to sigh, 'oh good, I didn't go all the way.'
				<br><br>
				Fortunately, in the case of how life is taken, I think we seem to be quite responsible.  Ther seriousness of that does not often have to be spelled out, and not many sermons need to be devoted to it.  But in the significance and sanctity of giving life, some of us are not so responsible, and in the larger world swirling around us we find near-criminal irresponsibility.  What would in the case of taking life bring absolute horror and demand grim justice, in the case of giving life brings dirty jokes, four-letter language, and wholesale voyeurism in movies, on television, over the internet, and almost everywhere else we turn.'"
			</p>
			<p class="general">
				Elder Holland gives three reasons why the issue of being morally clean is of such magnitude and consequence.  <b>The first concerns the doctrine of the soul</b>.  The LDS church doctrine that the soul of man is the body and spirit combined (D&C 88:15), is a unique doctrine in the Christian world.  Nowhere outside the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints is this eternal truth taught.  Furthermore, in D&C 93:34, we are taught that when the body and spirit are separated, we cannot receive a fullness of joy.  Elder Holland made this comment, quoting Elder Boyd K. Packer:
			</p>
			<p class="talkQuote">
				"So partly in answer to why such seriousness, we answer that when one toys with the God-given-and satanically coveted-body of another, he or she toys with the very soul of that individual, toys with the central purpose and product of life, 'the very key' to life as Elder Boyd K. Packer once called it.  In trivializing the soul (or body) of another we trivialize the atonement, which saved that soul and guaranteed its continued existence.  And when one toys with the Son of Righteousness, the Day Star Himself, one toys with white heat and a flame hotter and holier than the noonday sun.  You cannot do so and not be burned.  You cannot with impunity 'crucify ... the son of God afresh.' Exploitation of the body (or soul) is, in the last analysis, an exploitation of Him who is the light and the life of the world.
				<br><br>
				Why does God care so much about sexual transgression?  It it partly because of the precious gift offered by and through His Only Begotten Son to redeem the souls - bodies and spirits - we too often share and abuse in such cheap and tawdry ways."
			</p>
			<p class="general">
				The second reason is that <b>human intimacy deals with a symbol</b> that requires special sanctity.  It is a sacred, physical union ordained of God for a married couple.  Such an act of love between a man and a woman is a symbol of total union of all they possess.  He said this about the symbol:
			</p>
			<p class="talkQuote">
				"... with the union of all that they possess - their very hearts and minds, all their days and all their dreams.  They work together, they cry together, they enjoy Brahms and Beethoven and breakfast together, they sacrifice and save and live together for all the abundance that such a totally intimate life provides such a couple.  And the external symbol of that union, the physical manifestation of what is a far deeper spritual and metaphysical bonding, is the physical blending that is part of - indeed, a most beautiful and gratifying expression of - that larger, more complete union of eternal purpose and promise.
				<br><br>
				"... and that symbolism of 'one flesh' cannot be preserved, if we hastily, guiltily, and surreptitiously share intimacy in a darkened corner of a darkened hour, then just as hastily, guiltily, and surreptitiously retreat to our separate worlds - not to eat or live or cry or laugh together, not do the laundry and the dishes and the homework, not to manage a budget and pay the bills and tend the children and plan together for the future.  No, we cannot do that until we are truly one- united, bound, linked, tied, welded, sealed, married."
			</p>
			<p class="general">
				The third reason is that <b>sexual intimacy is symbolic of a union between mortals and deity,</b> uniting humans with God and all the powers by which He gives life.  In special, sacramental moments we are in circumstances where we symbolically unite with God and, in so doing, gain access to His power:
			</p>
			<p class="talkQuote">
				"Indeed, if our definition of sacrament is that act of claiming, sharing, and exercising God's own inestimitable power, then I know of no other virtually divine privilege so routinely given to us all - women or men, ordained or unordained, Latter-Day Saint or non-Latter-Day Saint - than the miraculous and majestic power of transmitting life, the unspeakable, unfathomable, unbroken power of procreation.""
				<br><br>
				"Imagine that, if you will. Veritable teenagers - and all of us for many decades thereafter - carrying daily, hourly, minute-to-minute, virtually every waking and sleeping moment of our lives, the power and the chemistry and the eternally transmitted seeds of life to grant someone else her second estate, someone else his next level of development in the divine plan of salvation.  I submit to you that no power, priesthood or otherwise, is given by God so universally to so many with vitually no control over its use except self control.  And I submit that we will never be more like God at any other time in this life than when we are expressing that particular power."

				"Fidelity in Marriage: It's More than You Think"
			</p>
			<p class="talkAuthor">
				Kenneth W. Matheson, Professor, School of Social Work, Brigham Young University
			</p>
			<p class="general">
				Total Fidelity in marriage is more than just avoiding physical infidelity.  It also means having emotional fidelity by keeping our emotions and thoughts focused only on our spouse.  Emotional infidelity usually starts with seemingly innocent conversations and attention, which feel innocent.  But if not corrected, emotional infidelity is an insidious threat that can destroy a marriage and family.  President Spencer W. Kimball counseled us to be faithful and remember the Lord's commandment to married couples:
			</p>
			<p class="talkQuote">
				"There are those married people who permit their eyes to wander and their hearts to become vagrant, who think it is not improper to flirt a little, to share their hearts and have desire for someone other than the wife or the husband.  The Lord says in no uncertain terms: 'Thou shalt love thy wife with all thy heart, and shalt cleave unto her and none else' (D&C 42:22).
				<br><br>
				And, when the Lord says all thy heart, it allows for no sharing nor dividing nor depriving.  And, to the woman it is paraphrased: 'Thou shalt love thy husband with all thy heart and shalt cleave unto him and none else.'
				<br><br>
				The words 'none else' eliminate everyone and everything.  The spouse then becomes preeminent in the life of the husband or wife, and neither social life nor occupational life nor political life nor any other interest nor person nor thing shall ever take precedence over the companion spouse."<br>(Spencer W. Kimball, Faith Precedes the Miracle, 1972, 142-143)
			</p>
			<p class="general">
				Professor Matheson provided a list of questions to ask ourselves to evaluate whether we need to improve our physical, emotional, or spiritual fidelity:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Are you turning to your friend for comfort rather than your spouse?</li>
				<li>Do you find yourself thinking about your friend even when you're at home?</li>
				<li>Do you seek opportunities to be with your friend even when work doesn't require you to be together?</li>
				<li>Do you E-mail and text your friend when you're not together?</li>
				<li>Have you told your spouse about these messages?</li>
				<li>Does the relationship with your friend take more of your time and energy than your relationship with your spouse?</li>
				<li>Do you compare your spouse to your friend?</li>
				<li>Would you be uncomfortable introducing your spouse to your friend?</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="general">
				Depending on how you answer these questions, you may need to make some changes in your life.
